	\item[F6] User must be able to view observations stored on the device
	\item[F7] User must be able to eidt a stored observation on the device
\end{description}

\subsection{Implementation}


	\subsubsection{Auto-complete}

	Auto-complete has been extended to read files based on species category.
	Initially each category was included in a separate file, this caused some
	performance issues due to the large amount of data (browser freeze while reading
	files). To circumvent this issue, we decided to split the categories into
	multiple files, keeping one folder per category and one file per prefix see.

	To achieve this, we will use the following conventions / specifications:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Auto-Complete data is rooted in the directory WEBROOT/data/autocomplete
		\item Each species category get a sub-folder in under the auto-complete
		root, this will be named after the category id (an integer)., this will
		be named after the category id (an integer).
		\item Each category directory should contain one index.js file that
		keeps an overview of all the prefix-files for the category.
		\item Files in the category directory are named by the following rules:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item a.json contains only entries prefixed by a
				\item a\_b.json contains entries prefixed by a or b (can be
				extended with more entries)
				\item a-z.json contains entries prefixed by a, b, c, ..., or z
				\item a\_c-e\_q\_t contains entries prefixed by a, c, d, e, q, or t
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing}

Auto-complete functionality was extended using test driven development, unit
tests were written before functionality was implemented (red-green).
