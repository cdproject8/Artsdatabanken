\subsection{Testing}

Testing uncovered inconsistencies in the storage API. Initially we planned to
use a function , Database.changeVersion(..), to migrate database schemas while
updating the app, unfortunately this only works for some versions of Android.
Due to preceding comment and time restrictions we dropped support for database
migration.

Following are functional tests for each of the completed requirements. We tested
each use case on different devices, after each test bug fixing was done. The
improvements can be seen in run 1 and run 3, run 3 is a re-test after fixing
bugs in version 0.9 (done on the same device). At the end all tests passed,
except test 5 (see comment on under Test 5 (run 3)).
