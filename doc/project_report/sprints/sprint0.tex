\subsection{Sprint Planning}
	Sprint 0 is planned to be introductory phase of this project and also beginning of the development process. During this sprint, team focused on making decisions about technologies that will be used, studying and getting familiar with the assigned problem. Focus is on choice of mobile platform, developing process and development of first demo application. Very important part of this sprint is also field study. Team members got familiar with species observation and principles used for adding new data to customers web application. First demo version should consist of simple user interface and some basic functionalities for transition between different views across the menu. Other advanced features, like autocomplete and communication with database.
	
	\subsubsection{Expected results}
	This sprint should provide significant knowledge about assigned problem and methods for their resolution. Preliminary study is very important part of this sprint. Also, first demo version should be provided, and all important decisions about technical and logical aspect of the project should be made.
	
	\subsubsection{Duration}
	Start of Sprint 0 is September 4th, and it will last until September 12th (week 36). During this sprint, field study is scheduled for September 5th. Customer meeting is on the same day, and advisor meeting is on September 6th.

\subsection{Customer Feedback}
	After completion of this sprint, and before beginning of sprint 1, meeting with customer was held on September 13th. Team presented conclusions obtained on preliminary study, and also first demo version and graphical user interface made for this application. Customer agreed on our choices and application design, and also gave some useful suggestions about colour plan and some other issues. PhoneGap proved to be good choice for development, and customers requirement for cross-platform solution will be satisfied. As requested on meeting, next sprint should be focused on autocomplete of species names while making new observation. Team suggested some new tasks for next sprint, like making local storage for data collected and remembered during observation, but after a discussion customer decided to give priority to autocomplete, and to leave development of local storage for next sprint.
	
\subsection{Evaluation}
	This shorter, but not less important sprint provided very valuable information and a lot of decisions that will guide the rest of the development process.
