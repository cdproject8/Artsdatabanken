\section{Sprint 0}

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
For this sprint, we plan to get familiar with the project, and make important
decisions about technologies and development processes. We will conduct a field
study at Artsdatabanken where we will get an introduction into species
observation and the process behind it. In addition to this, we will make a
prototype of the user interface in jQuery Mobile to show the customer what our
plan for the application is. This is done to clear up most of the
misunderstandings about the requirements as early as possible, and give the
customer feedback about what our vision of the application is. 

Sprint 0 is an introductionary sprint, and will not run for two full weeks.

\subsubsection{Expected results}
This sprint should provide significant
insight into the problem domain, and how we are going to solve it. The
preliminary study is a very important part of this sprint. In addition, the
first demo should be provided, and all important decisions about technical and
logical aspect of the project should be made.

\subsubsection{Duration}
Start of Sprint 0 is September 4th, and it will last
until September 11th (week 36). During this sprint, the field study is
scheduled for September 5th. The scheduled customer meeting is on the same
day, and the advisor meeting is on September 6th.

\subsection{Customer Feedback}
At the end of this sprint we held a meeting with
the customer on September 13th. The team presented the conclusions obtained in
the preliminary study, in addition to the first demo of the application. The
customer agreed upon our choices and application design, and also gave some
useful suggestions about the colors and design guidelines for Artsdatabanken.
PhoneGap proved to be a good choice for development.  As requested in the
customer meeting, the next sprint should focus on auto-completion of species
names when making a new observation.

\subsection{Evaluation}
This shorter, but not less important sprint, provided
very valuable information about the problem domain. A lot of decisions were made
that will continue to guide the rest of the development process. From the
preliminary study, the team now has a good understanding of the problem domain.
A lot of important issues were discussed in detail, such as development
environment, programming and scripting languages, field study etc. All members
were involved in this discussions, including both the advisor and the customer.
In addition, the sprint included some programming, and laid the foundation for
further development.  The customer agreed with most of our suggestions, and gave
us guidelines for further development and studies.  Documentation was done by
the whole team, and the progress was very satisfactory. However, documenting a
lot of things in a short time led to lower document quality. After consultation
with the advisor, it was decided that a lot of key changes should be made in
next the sprint, and the document should be reorganized.
