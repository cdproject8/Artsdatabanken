\section{Sprint 0}

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
	Sprint 0 was the introductory phase of this project and also the beginning of the development process. During this sprint, the team focused on making decisions about technologies, development processes, and studies into the problem domain. The focus was on choice of mobile platform, the development process and the development of the first demo application. One of the most important parts of this sprint was also the field study. The group got familiar with species observation and principles used for adding new data to the customers web application.\newline
  At the end of this sprint we also presented the customer with the first demo of the application, focusing on the user interface.
	
	\subsubsection{Expected results}
	This sprint should provide significant insight into the problem domain, and how we are going to solve it. The preliminary study is a very important part of this sprint. In addition, the first demo should be provided, and all important decisions about technical and logical aspect of the project should be made.
	
	\subsubsection{Duration}
	Start of Sprint 0 is September 4th, and it will last until September 11th (week 36). During this sprint, the field study is scheduled for September 5th. The scheduled customer meeting is on the same day, and the advisor meeting is on September 6th.

\subsection{Customer Feedback}
	At the end of this sprint we held a meeting with the customer on September 13th. The team presented the conclusions obtained in the preliminary study, in addition to the first demo of the application. The customer agreed upon our choices and application design, and also gave some useful suggestions about the colors and design guidelines for Artsdatabanken. PhoneGap proved to be a good choice for development.
As requested in the customer meeting, the next sprint should focus on auto-completion of species names when making a new observation.
	
\subsection{Evaluation}
	This shorter, but not less important sprint, provided very valuable information about the problem domain. A lot of decisions were made that will continue to guide the rest of the development process. From the preliminary study, the team now has a good understanding of the problem domain. A lot of important issues were discussed in detail, such as development environment, programming and scripting languages, field study etc. All members were involved in this discussions, including both the advisor and the customer. In addition, the sprint included some programming, and laid the foundation for further development. 
	The customer agreed with most of our suggestions, and gave us guidelines for further development and studies.
Documentation was done by the whole team, and the progress was very satisfactory. However, documenting a lot of things in a short time led to lower document quality. After consultation with the advisor, it was decided that a lot of key changes should be made in next the sprint, and the document should be reorganized.
