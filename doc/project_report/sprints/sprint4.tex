\section{Sprint 4 TODO}

\subsection{Sprint Planning}

This is the last sprint in this project. The group intended to finish all the
requirements in the sprint backlog and formally close major functionality
development. In this sprint, the team worked on rectifying the technical errors
in the implementation of early sprint requirements, especially getting to work
the exporting functionality fully. GPS location and camera functionalities are
also planned to be completed here.

\subsubsection{Expected results}

Sprint 4 will mark the end of our sprints and all the requirements will have
been completed and working by the end of this sprint. The expected result is
the export functionality, the GPS location and Picture taking (camera)
functionality will be working.	

\subsubsection{Duration}

Sprint 4 began on October 24th in week 43 and will last on November 6th in week
44. Sprint 4 has a duration of two weeks just like any of the other sprints.
The team held its customer meeting for this sprint on Tuesday October 25, 2011
and the advisor meeting was on the same date in the afternoon.

\subsection{Requirements}

Some of the requirements are from sprint 2 and the goal is to make them free
from bugs and issues and focus more on exporting the the observation.

\begin{description}
	\item[F5] User must be able to take a picture with the devices's camera.
	\item[F8] User must be able to update the local database of species and locations
	\item[F9] An observation must contain GPS coordinates of where it was created.
\end{description}

\subsection{Implementation}

	\subsubsection{Auto-complete}

	Implemented tools for downloading and parsing data from the new API
	provided by Artsdatabanken. This required us to change some URL's and use
	literal names instead of ID's in requests. Using literal names was a bit
	problematic as Artsdatabanken is including some special characters in the
	literal names that are not actually supported by the API (using commas in a
	request cause the API to return an SQL error).

  We ran into some problems with the new API however. We could only retrieve 500 species at a time. The logic behind the added requests and the storing of data on the phone as files is very complex, making it a project in itself. We therefore chose a different approach by making the application have periodic updates via the Android Market. We have created a script that can parse the API and create the appropriate JSON-files for use in the application. This will also be included in the finished product. 

\subsection{Testing}

Testing uncovered inconsistencies in the storage API. Initially we planned to
use a function , Database.changeVersion(..), to migrate database schemas while
updating the app, unfortunately this only works for some versions of Android.
Due to preceding comment and time restrictions we dropped support for database
migration.

\subsection{Customer Feedback}

\subsection{Evaluation}

F8 was the most challenging requirement other than the exporting functionality.
We had to roll on exporting functionality across 3 sprint, but the team managed
to complete that in time...
