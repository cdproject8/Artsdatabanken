\subsection{User Interface}
\subsubsection{Overview}
The choice of Phonegap for developing a cross compiling mobile application gave us the possibility to use HTML/CSS for application design. The team was able to use existing libraries and templates (CSS, javascript, html, etc.).
The JavaScript library, jQuery along with jQuery Mobile, with its touch-optimized layouts and its good design and simplicity was found to be a suitable choice for the application development and was therefore chosen.

\subsubsection{Choice of Template}
Artsdatabanken does have a webpage optimized for mobile phones, which also uses jQuery mobile. The customer wanted the application to have the same template as the webpage. To do that the team used the CSS file from the webpage in the application. This way, the application is managed to look very similar to the mobile webpage.

\subparagraph{Main Screen}
The figure above shows the main screen of the application. The buttons are clear and the user can simply do a selection.
When the user makes a selection, the selected button becomes blue and the user is sure that the right button is pressed.

\subparagraph{New Observation}
After selecting New Observation, the page transitions into the window displayed in figure~\ref{fig:observation}. Here the user selects the Species.
Their names are displayed, with pictures on the side. More species are listed; the user needs to slide the interface using a finger to see those.

The selection will give a feedback to the user, like in the main screen.

There is a back button on the top left. This button will lead to the previous window.

After selecting the species; bird, the user is given a new window (figure~\ref{fig:bird}).
This is the window where the information about the observation is added.

The user can fill the fields easily by selecting the field that are required to be to fill. The selected field is marked with a blue shadow so the user knows which field is selected.
The species field has an auto-complete function, which makes it simpler for the user to type the correct name.

This leads to a new window (shown in figure~\ref{fig:addmore}). To go back after entering new data, the user selects the back button.

 \end{figure}
 \subparagraph{Add New Species}
