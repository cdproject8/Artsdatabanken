\subsection{Sprint Planning}

	Sprint 1 saw the beginning of actual development. The customer wanted us to focus on getting file I/O and autocomplete working for the first sprint. This would allow us to get the basic functionality of the app working as soon as possible.

	\subsubsection{Expected results}
	
	\subsubsection{Duration}
	Start of Sprint 1 is September 12th, and it will last until September 25th (weeks 37 and 38). Customer meeting is on September 27th, just after the completion of whole sprint. Advisor meetings are on September 13th and September 20th.
	
\subsection{Requirements}

	Relevant requirements for this sprint are F1 (Creating an observation) and F10 (Autocomplete). See section \ref{sec:usecases} for details.


\subsection{Testing}

	Most of the test related effort in this sprint was used to prepare the
	testing framework, consisting of QUnit for unit testing and mockjax for
	mocking AJAX requests / responses. See \ref{sec:qunit}. We decided to run
	the tests on normal (desktop / laptop) computers as it was problematic to
	run directly on mobile devices. Using techniques like mocking we should
	still be able to generate a good test coverage.

	We implemented unit tests for the filtering mechanism involved in our custom
	auto-complete function. All tests passed (see \ref{sec:unit-tests}).
