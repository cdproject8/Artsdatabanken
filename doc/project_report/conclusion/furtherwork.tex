\subsection{Conclusions}
This project has been an enormous help in making ourselves fit for a real software development environment. We were actually very delighted to have made our customer happy with no reservations whatsoever. We dealt with a number of new and challenging aspects of software development. It, indeed, was a unique course well designed to provide us with the opportunity to work in completely different environment than the usual school exercises we are normally used to. From working seamlessly with people of different cultural background to our coordinated effort in selecting the right implementation technology to making our customer satisfied to fulfilling our requirements, we have been able to gain an invaluable insight on how to communicate, schedule, execute and deliver expectations under pressure. We have had challenges, shortcomings and unexpected events that were out of our control but the level of diligence the member of the groups showed and commitment for the successful completion of the project are some of the things that are worth mentioning.

In such a short time, we have managed to implement and document such a decent product that made our customer, advisor and our group members happy not to mention the extremely invaluable experience of working with real customers and their strict expectations.
