\subsection{Conclusions}
This project has been an enormous help in making ourselves fit for a real software development environment. We were actually very delighted to have made our customer happy with no reservations whatsoever. We dealt with a number of new and challenging aspects of software development. It, indeed, was a unique course well designed to provide us with the opportunity to work in completely different environment than the usual school exercises we are normally used to. From working seamlessly with people of different cultural background to our coordinated effort in selecting the right implementation technology to making our customer satisfied to fulfilling our requirements, we have been able to gain an invaluable insight on how to communicate, schedule, execute and deliver expectations under pressure. We have had challenges, shortcomings and unexpected events that were out of our control but the level of diligence the member of the groups showed and commitment for the successful completion of the project are some of the things that are worth mentioning.

Our implementation went according to plan and our use of JavaScript in PhoneGap was quite effective.
PhoneGap had it's limitations and reduced performance compared to native implementations but helped us with GUI work and allowed us to code in an environment and language we were already familiar with.
The app is a fully functional prototype, but will probably need a little tweaking before fully releasing it to the public.
Our customer also found our research and issues with the usability of the app interesting for their further work with mobile implementations of observations.
Mainly how convenient it actually is, undeniably a large portion of the users will not think it is faster or easier to use it over a sheet of paper.
