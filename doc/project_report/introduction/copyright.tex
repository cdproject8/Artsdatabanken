\subsection{Copyright}

In the compendium of this project \cite[Section~3.9]{compendium}, it is stated: "legally and by default (Berne convention), the copyright (or IPR) belongs to those 
(the students) that have their names on the front page of the actual work.".\newline
It is therefore up to the students themselves to deal with the IPR of the application.
