\subsection{Nonfunctional requirements} Non-functional requirements are system
quality attributes or constraints that describe how a system performs its prime
functionality.  They are characterized by having no clear cut criteria to
determine or their criteria changes depending on the environment and
development strategies\cite{req:requirements-technique2}.  Non-functional
requirements state a series of quality or constraints that could influence
service delivery, development choice, system owner and end user needs.  They
are used to specify the criteria used to judge the overall operations of a
system, rather than specific behaviors.  The non-functional requirements for
this project are elicited in accordance with the ISO 9126 document
recommendation.  The ISO 9126 particularly focuses on quality in use of a
software system.  A short summarization of ISO 9126 is described in the
development process section of this documentation.  \\[0.4cm]

\subsubsection{Quality of service}
    \paragraph{Security, reliability and performance}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The system should not force users to wait for longer periods of time
        \item The system should not lose offline data
        \item The system should not breach the privacy of an observer
        \item The system should be durable
	\end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Accuracy}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system should not cause unexpected alteration of input data
            \item The system should not cause decline of image quality
            \item The system should accurately export data
        \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Interface}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The user interface should be consistent with Artsdatabanken's style
            \item The user interface should have an intuitive design
            \item The user interface should be sufficiently fast
            \item The user interface should be optimized for mobile devices
            \item The user interface should operate smoothly across multiple platforms
        \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Compliance}
		\begin{itemize}
		     \item The system should not violate the usage agreements for target platforms
             \item The system should comply with device platform recommendations were possible
             \item The system should comply with user privacy requirements
             \item The system should comply with security requirements of the software owners
	    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Architectural design}
    \begin{itemize}
		\item The architecture should be clearly defined
		\item The architecture should not hinder upgrades / updates 
		\item The architecture should adhere to best practices in software development
        \item The system should be maintainable
        \item The system should have easily replaceable components
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Development paradigm}
    \begin{itemize}
		\item The development paradigm should encourage regression testing
		\item The system should be developed using test driven development
    \end{itemize}
