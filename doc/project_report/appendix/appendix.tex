\section{User guide TODO}
This portion of the document details installation guides for the user, in addition to a how-to for the application. This should provide the user with adequate information about how to install and use the application.
\subsection{Installation guide}
The application can be downloaded from the Android Market, with the name "Artsdatabanken". It can also be installed directly from an executable installation package, an apk, by going to the following url: \url{http://stuff.daginge.com/artsdatabanken.apk}.

However, if the user wishes to install the latest build, see Developers guide.

\subsection{How-to}
\subsubsection{Creating an observation}
The user creates an observation by following the "Create and observation" link from the front page of the application. From here, the user selects which species group to observe. This will lead the user to an observation table, where the user can input species name, which is auto-completed, and the number of individuals found. Both common names and scientific names are applicable. From here, the user can choose to add more information about the species observation by selecting "Add more information".

\subsubsection{Storing an observation TODO}
This will come

\subsubsection{Editing a stored observation TODO}
More to come
