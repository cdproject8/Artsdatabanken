\subsection{Conclusion}
In this chapter we have looked at different technologies and compared them to each other.  We have discussed and concluded on many important decisions for the ongoing project. This pre-study will help us and our client in current and future projects.

In summary, the team will use a modification of the SCRUM methodology, that will provide the team with the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements specification, continuous delivery and test-driven development. The application will be developed using the PhoneGap framework, and it will be published on multiple platforms with the help of PhoneGap build. For the user interface and application behaviour, we will use jQuery Mobile. 

For version control, the team will use git, and the main repository will be published on GitHub, as an Open Source application. All documentation will be written in LaTeX.
