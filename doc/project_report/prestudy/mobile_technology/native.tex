\paragraph{\bf{Native}}
	Building applications natively is the best option if we look at each device
	separately. This ensures that your application always works, and you can
	utilize all the tools provided to you in the native API. With native
	applications you can also build applications more in conform with design
	guidelines for your platform, with native elements. This increases
	usability.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Must develop for each individual platform. This means different
		languages and APIs for every platform.
		\item Can utilize design guidelines for individual platforms, making
		apps similar to the user, increasing usability.
		\item Can access more functions in the API, creating cutting edge
		applications with the newest APIs
		\item Native applications runs faster and better on the phone
	\end{itemize}
