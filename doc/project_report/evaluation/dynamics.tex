\subsection{Group dynamics}
In this section we will discuss how the group has worked throughout the project, and look at some evaluations done within the group about motivation and work environment. 

\subsubsection{Week 8 internal group evaluation}
By week 8 we has an internal group evaluation of how the group felt the project was going, the motivation of the group, and an evaluation of each members work task. We will look at the results from this questionnaire and what steps we took to improve these results.

\paragraph{Conclusion}
Based on our findings and an internal group meeting, we concluded that having weekly meetings every Monday where we recap the previous week and discuss the plan for the next week would boost the motivation of the group. This would also help the documentation team better understand what the programmers were doing, and vice versa. It was also recognized that we should have had a similar questionnaire at an earlier time, so the necessary steps needed were taken sooner in the project.

However, we also noted that in general, motivation was high, and the group felt the project was going well.
