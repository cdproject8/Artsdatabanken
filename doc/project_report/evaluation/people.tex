\subsection{People involved}
	\subsubsection{Customer}
One of the things that had been so helpful in this course was having the customer we had. Our customer was an incredibly helpful person. He went an extra length to make sure we had a good understanding of what his requirements were, he also invested his time to train some of our group members the trickier system of taxonomy---a species naming system, and the company organized a field work for us so we could experience the task in the requirements first hand.

Our customer exactly knew what he wanted, and his requirements were already well thought with crisp description. He gave us a green field as to how we approached his requirements as long as we met his expectations. He gave us the independence to test our ideas, select our own technology and methodology only intervening when necessary and explicitly requested. In addition to that, he replied to our emails on time with the necessary information and attended our meetings consistently as planned.

The customer had also a deeper understanding of their existing system---including the weaknesses, strengths and the semantics of the business areas plus where exploitation of current implementations of their system might come handy to our prototype.

Since we had to do every form of communication in English, and none of us were native speakers of the language, language was one of the things we had to take into consideration to guarantee reliable and clearer understanding between everyone involved, our customer had a good command of the English language and our communications took place without any difficulty.

We usually held our customer meeting at the beginning of every sprint and he actively promoted ideas he seemed to like and suggested improvements.  His guidance was so helpful to avoid misguided approaches and fuzzy implementation procedures with lackluster outcomes.

	\subsubsection{Advisor}
We were lucky to have a responsible advisor whose intuitive advise has enormously helped us stay on track, be goal oriented, keep up with ours and our customers expectations and on the amount of work to be done in each week. His advices were very honest, professional and comprehensive. He spoke his mind and we use the honest remarks to make improvements on our work strategy and progress. He attended all our meetings on time and our communication in English has turned out to be excellent.

The remarks he gave us on our architecture, document organization, requirements specification, customer etiquettes and customer agreement suggestions were some of the most invaluable insights that facilitated our approach towards the task at hand.

The weekly advisor meetings have been key reference points to gauge our progress, documentation quality and milestone settings.
	\subsubsection{Team}
  The team consists of 7 fourth year students of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Five student are enrolled in the Master of Computer Science program, and two are enrolled in the International Master in Computer Science. We feel that the group dynamics has worked out well, and our project has benefited greatly from that. A huge part of this is the excellent spoken and written English of the group, which has proved to be invaluable in good communication and cooperation between the group members.
