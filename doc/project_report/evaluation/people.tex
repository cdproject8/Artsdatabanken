\subsection{People involved and the course}
	\subsubsection{Customer}

%ok
One of the things that have been very helpful in this course was having the
customer we had. He went an extra mile to make sure we had a good understanding
of what his requirements were, he invested his time to train some of our
group members the trickier system of taxonomy - a scientific species naming
system, and the company organized a field work for us so we could experience the
task in the requirements first hand.

%ok
There was very little ambiguity in our communication with the customer. This 
Allowed us to relatively quickly define our requirements, which saw only minor alterations during the project.
He gave us the independence to test our
ideas, select our own technology and methodology, only intervening when
necessary and explicitly requested. In addition to that, he was answered any questions we had by email.

%ok
The customer also had a deeper understanding of their existing system, including
the weaknesses, strengths and the semantics of the business areas of
Artsdatabanken. He provided helpful insight into using the existing 
back-end systems, such as the open API for species offered by Artsdatabanken.

%ok
Since we had to do every form of communication in English, and none of us were
native speakers of the language, language was one of the things we had to take
into consideration to guarantee reliable and clearer understanding between
everyone involved. Fortunately, our customer had no problems using english, so we hadd little difficulty in our communication.

%ok
We held our customer meeting at the beginning of every sprint in which our customer
actively promoted ideas he seemed to like and suggested improvements.  His
guidance was very helpful to avoid misguided approaches and fuzzy implementation
procedures.

	\subsubsection{Advisor}
	%ok
We were lucky to have a responsible advisor whose  advice has
helped us stay on track, be goal oriented, keep up with ours and our
customers expectations and on the amount of work to be done each week. His
advice were very honest, professional and comprehensive. He spoke his mind and
we used the honest remarks to make improvements on our work strategy and
progress.

%ok i guess
The weekly advisor meetings have been key reference points to gauge our
progress, document quality and milestone settings. It also helped us stay
motivated throughout the project, and his experience helped us avoid the biggest
pitfalls of the project.

\subsubsection{Team}
%ok
  The team consists of 7 fourth year computer science students.
  Five students are enrolled in the Master of Computer
  Science program here at the Norwegian University of
  Science and Technology, and two are enrolled in the International Master in Computer
  Science. We feel that the group dynamics has worked out well, we have had very few internal conflicts. 
  This is likely at least in part due to our ability to communicate well among ourselves, despite language barriers.
  
%ok
  All group members feel that the workload has been evenly distributed, and we
  have carefully taken into consideration other classes and distributed work
  accordingly, so that no one fell behind in other classes because of the
  project. This has proved to be key in the success of the project, because
  motivation was high throughout the entire process, making us more effective in
  completing our weekly goals.

\subsubsection{The course}

%ok
   This course is special in that it required not only skills
   in computer science but also a string of skills that we had garnered all
   along our educational stay in the university. This course helped us test our
   fitness for a professional software engineering atmosphere. We have been able
   to employ our skills from requirements elicitation and engineering to
   software design and technical writing. The course had such an extensive
   coverage of subjects in computer science it gave us a means to
   summarize and reinforce our previous knowledge in information systems.

%ok
   The course had its own share of challenges. Managing groups, customer
   communication, advisor guidelines and the actual work itself was something
   which tested our skill and patience. At times, we have found the course work
    intimidating and more than what we were used to. In our case,
   we were fortunate to have the right number of group members to keep our work load manageable throughout the project
   We experienced that even though some group
   members fell ill or were busy with other courses, we still managed to
   keep the workload reasonable. This was due to our ability to redistribute our human resources.
   
   The support the course gets from advisor in the form of weekly meetings, the
   compendiums at the beginning of the course, and reserves of previous projects
   for reference has helped us cope with the challenges. We feel that the course
   has helped motivate us to continue our work in this field, and we have gained
   a lot of experience in handling internal and external sources of conflict
   throughout the project.
