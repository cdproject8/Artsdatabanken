\subsection{The application}
	
    \subsubsection{Deliverables}
    When the group set out on this project and it's successful completion, everyone knew that challenges, all along the way, were going to be an ineradicable part of this project. To plan for the worst and take preemptive action, we sat together and designed the project plan, a risk analysis and mitigation strategy---should anything goes wrong, a consensual agreement on implementation technology, a decision on time schedule and other key administrative routines.

    Planning administrative and procedural routines ahead of any actual work contributed considerably to keep everyone on the same page. We actually managed to finish 90 percent of the requirements we elicited together with requirements the customer approved and accepted.

    The group thought it would be wise to let people work and focus where they are best, which resulted in excellent performance in the programming and documentation sections. To realize the requirements from paper work to a physical implementation, people who invested so much time in the programming department worked day and night relentlessly to implement all the requirements on paper, despite the fact that that each member has a responsibility in other courses as well. And group member whose focus was on documentation and administration did a superb job to rearrange requirement specification accordingly, document sprints, handle status reports, and document implementations.

    The collaboration and common understanding between the group members enabled us to finish a beta application version early and send it for test to our customer, the result of which will be presented in another section.

    According to our agreement with our customer, the application was to be delivered as a prototype with certain functionalities being nonnegotiable part of the prototyping. We managed to implement all the nonnegotiable functionalities and test them. In our opinion, it is safe to say that we completed this application successfully with 90 percent functionality completed and working according to our customers expectation. Growing time pressure and the length of time it would take to complete the one and only uncompleted less priority but high complexity requirement has forced us to document an implementation strategy for it and leave it at there. We have had a discussion with our customer about that and we have his nod of approval.

    Overall, our application was delivered as specified by the customer and the group has tried to do everything possible to conform to the customer's requirements and meet his expectation.
	\subsubsection{Final version and deployment}
The application we delivered to the customer is only a prototype. It needs a certain degree of performance tuning for general public use, and also to bring it up to a professional par.

The final version of the application we published to our customer does the functionalities specified in the requirements. The app is a cross-platform mobile app that can be run on Android and iOS based mobile devices. We have actually not been able to test it on i-family devices, due to the fact that none of us had an i-family device and the assumption was for the customer to provide an i-family testing device. But the customer failed to provide the device and recommended we focus our testing effort on Android based devices and forgo iOS based testing.

%But the application testing on Android device went well as expected and we carried out an actual test on actual users of our customers.


	\subsubsection{Customer response}
The customer was made to be involved actively in the process and he was consulted from the beginning to the end of the project. We made sure he knew what was going on in the technology, mode of implementation and our schedule to remotely eliminate unexpected surprises.

All along, the customer's feedback was positive and encouraging. At this point we are unaware of anything that might have gone against the expectations of the customer.
We have included his suggestions and recommendations and any changes and modifications took place with his opinions factored in.

We believe that we managed to satisfy his expectations and that he had no reservations.
