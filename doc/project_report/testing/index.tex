\section{Testing}
\label{sec:testresult}

One of the key tasks that have been planned in this project was testing. In
section \ref{sec:testing}, a detailed purpose, plan and focus of our testing
strategy has been outlined. Having finished the prototype, it is very important
that each requirements were tested to make sure that no functionality
misbehaves or fails to perform as expected. Each of the nine requirements were
tested and the test results are documented in this section. This section
somewhat describes what has happened with the pilot prototype, a number of
modification have been incorporated as the testing went on to correct defects.
Several tests have been conducted on each functionality and code section during
the sprints, but this section is the final test result documentation that
declares each requirement as either working or not working.

The result of usability testing is also included as part of this section. The
usability test section tries to show how our prototype fared in the user space
of actual Artsdatabanken users. It gives a preview of how the application has
been received, criticized and modification prompts that arise from users.

\subsection{Usability test result}

Artsdatabanken contracted a company to carry out a professional usability
testing for the prototype we shipped. Artsdatabanken preferred to conduct the
usability test by itself and report the results back to us. However, our
customer managed to sign up only 3 users for the test, a participant number
which is significantly lower than our minimum specification of 20 participants.
The plan was to analyze the results using standard statistical result analysis
methods---showing the preference, skill and acceptance of the application which
would have been reflected by a reasonable sample size. When, in statistics,
bigger sample size gives better results\cite{statistics}, deriving any
conclusions from a sample size of three will be unrealistic and the result, if
any, will be a bogus one. We only chose to document the forms we prepared for
the usability test.

Below are some of the screenshots of our online usability test from. We found
it inconvenient to show the full HTML form in an appealing way on this
document.  You can find the full form on http://
