\section{Testing}
\label{sec:testresult}
One of the key tasks that have been planned in this project was testing. In section \ref{sec:testing}, a detailed purpose, plan and focus of our testing strategy has been outlined. Having finished the prototype, it is very important that each requirements were tested to make sure that no functionality misbehaves or fails to perform as expected. Each of the nine requirements were tested and the test results are documented in this section. This section somewhat describes what has happened with the pilot prototype, a number of modification have been incorporated as the testing went on to correct defects. Several tests have been conducted on each functionality and code section during the sprints, but this section is the final test result documentation that declares each requirement as either working or not working.

The result of usability testing is also included as part of this section. The usability test section tries to show how our prototype fared in the user space of actual Artsdatabanken users. It gives a preview of how the application has been received, criticized and modification prompts that arise from users.
