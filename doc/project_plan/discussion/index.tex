\subsection{XML API}

The customer provided an XML API for queries with regards to species. The
format was problematic to use for a mobile application due to processing and
bandwidth limitations. To circumvent this problem we implemented a build script
that downloaded and parsed relevant data into a suitable format (JSON). This data
was included in the app itself.

\subsection{Support for multiple platforms}

To accommodate multiple platforms we decided on PhoneGap, a framework that make
use of the built-in browsers in mobile devices. PhoneGap relies scripting
languages like JavaScript which is less efficient than native code. This can
result in excluding users with less expensive devices.
