\subsection{Methodology}
In this project we have decided to use an adaption of the SCRUM-methodology, an agile methodology. We chose this method of development because of the highly volatile nature of requirements. The project description and domain is very loosely defined, and we expect the requirements to change significantly during the development of the application. In addition, the customer and the advisor from IDI recommended we used an agile methodology.

However, as previously stated, we will only use an adaption of the SCRUM methodology. We will perform daily standups, use sprint planning, have a product owner and a scrum master. However, we will not strictly employ standards such as SCRUM board. We will also be agile in our use of the sprint plan, taking into consideration the ever changing requirements.

\subsubsection{Project phases}
Our project will loosely follow the following plan:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduction
  \item Planning and project management
  \item Pre-study
  \item Sprint 0
  \item Sprint 1
  \item Sprint 2
  \item Sprint 3
  \item Sprint 4
  \item Documentation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sprints}
Each sprint will consist of four, blendable phases.
TODO: Image here, items for now
\begin{itemize}
  \item Plan
  \item Implement
  \item Test
  \item Document
\end{itemize}

\bf{Plan} The plan phase of each sprint represents the time it takes to distribute work, plan how we are going to complete
