\subsection{Tech comparison}

\subsubsection{Android}

	Android is an operating system developed for a variety of mobile devices.
	It is based on the linux kernel, and provides a developer-friendly
	framework for app development (subset of Java, Dalvik virtual machine).
	Most of it's code is released under the Apache Licence, a free software
	licence.

	Android was listed as the best-selling smartphone platform worldwide in Q4
	2010 by Canalys. \cite{wiki:android}

	\paragraph{Pros}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can be developed using any major operating system (linux, windows, ...)
			\item Android devices can be emulated (AVD). This allows for testing on
			different screen sizes, etc.
			\item Developer-friendly
			\item Open source
		\end{itemize}

	\paragraph{Cons}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Apps developed for Android will not run on iOS or Windows phones
		\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{iOS}

	iOS is Apple's mobile operating system.

	\paragraphs{Cons}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Fashion product, lacks functionality
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item iOs development requires
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Macintosh running Mac OSX
				\item iFamily device for testing
			\end{itemize}
		\item iOS based applications can be developed on iPad or IPod Touch, but
		these devices lack accelerometer, compass, build-in GPS and camera
		accessibility facilities
		\item Apple is not fond of GPL or free software, this makes it
		problematic to use and develop open source solutions 
	\end{itemize}
