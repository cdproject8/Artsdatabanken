\subsection{Tech comparison}

\subsubsection{Android}

	Android is an operating system developed for a variety of mobile devices.
	It is based on the linux kernel, and provides a developer-friendly framework
	for app development (Dalvik virtual machine). Most of it's code is released
	under the Apache Licence, a free software licence.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can be developed using any major operating system (linux, windows, ...)
		\item Does not require any specialized hardware
		\item Android devices can be emulated (AVD). This allows for testing on
		different screen sizes, etc.
		\item Open source
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{iOs}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item iOs development requires
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Macintosh running Mac OSX
				\item iFamily device for testing
			\end{itemize}
		\item iOS based applications can be developed on iPad or IPod Touch, but
		these devices lack accelerometer, compass, build-in GPS and camera
		accessibility facilities
		\item Apple is not fond of GPL or free software, this makes it
		problematic to use and develop open source solutions 
	\end{itemize}
