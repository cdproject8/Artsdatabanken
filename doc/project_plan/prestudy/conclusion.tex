\subsection{Pre-Study conclusion and decisions}

This chapter provides valuable information about research and choices of different important issues for ongoing project. It discusses about many technical and logical aspects necessary to make development process better and faster.\newline

As a development process, team will use slight modification of scrum model. This should provide better response from the customer, shorter time until functional application, more customer satisfaction and less requirement changes. Gathered requirements will be analysed using MOWAHS technique. Application will be developed using PhoneGap platform in Ecilpse development environment. The final product will be available on Android and iOS operating systems at least, as it is agreed with customer. Different kinds of mobile networks will be used for synchronising data and updating. Basic programming and scripting languages in use will be HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, jQuery Mobile etc. Product should satisfy ISO 9126 quality standard, and for software versioning and revision control, team will use GitHub repository system. All necessary documentation related to this projet will be written using LaTeX technology. After different testing methods, software should be developed to customer with most of the required functionality.
