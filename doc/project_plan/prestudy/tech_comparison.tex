\subsection{Tech comparison}

\subsubsection{Android}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can be developed using any major operating system (linux, windows, ...)
		\item Does not require any specialized hardware
		\item Android devices can be emulated (AVD). This allows for testing on
		different screen sizes, etc.
		\item Open source
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{iOs}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item iOs development requires
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Macintosh running Mac OSX
				\item iFamily device for testing
			\end{itemize}
		\item iOS based applications can be developed on iPad or IPod Touch, but
		these devices lack accelerometer, compass, build-in GPS and camera
		accessibility facilities
		\item Apple is not fond of GPL or free software, problematic to use and
		develop open source solutions 
	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Phonegap}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Applications can be developed for Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android,
		Microsoft’s Windows Mobile, Nokia’s Symbian OS, RIM’s BlackBerry and bada.
		\item Enables developers to take advantage of JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3,
		which they might have already been familiar with.
		\item Access Native features such as compass, camera, network, media,
		notifications, sound, vibrate and storage etc.
		\item Open source
	\end{itemize}
