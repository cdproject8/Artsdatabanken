\subsection{Autocomplete}

	\subsubsection{Introduction}
	The customer wanted the application to autocomplete species names as they were typed in. 
	That means that when someone wants to enter an observation for a species and starts typing in it's name, the application will suggest species based on what the user has typed in so far. 
	This will help speed up the use of the application and also help with reducing typographical errors (typoes).

	Artsdatabanken provided us with an XML API on our customer meeting on September 13th. 
	To get obtain the list of names for all the species to be used with autocomplete. 
	We needed to download XML documents separately for each species group containing loads of information (~40 MB for butterflies).
	Amongst these documents two were massive, with one containing over half a million lines of xml data. 
	Three were quite big, another three fairly small with the rest almost empty. With a total of 30 categories at the time, several of which will most likely not be used.

	The API could not be used as is because the application needs to use this feature while offline. Because of this these generated XML files would have to be downloaded for use offline.

	\subsubsection{Processing}
	The files collected from the Artsdatabanken were quite extensive, containing a lot more information than needed, and in their raw form would take up unreasonably large space on the phones memory. 
	Because of this we had to parse the xml files into other a more usable format, at first we created a new xml file with just the information needed. 
	This was slightly tweaked by making json files instead.

	All the data was downloaded from
\newline"http://webtjenester.artsdatabanken.no/Artsnavnebase.asmx/Artstre? \newline LatinskNavnID=\textless species id\textgreater\&Dybde=-1".
	Where \textless species id\textgreater ranges from 75 to 105. "Dybde" or depth in english, signifies that the fetched xml file should contain all species in the entire subtree.
	The API interface used generates a species list organized in a tree structure, based on subgroups of species with a lot of additional information.

	The only information we needed to use were the norwegian and scientific names, therefore we created an xml parser using a php script that generated an XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation\cite{w3:xslt}) of the xml file to be transformed into whatever format we liked.
	Because many names are the same in both norwegian bokm√•l and norwegian nynorsk and for other reasons there were duplicates.
	The file was sorted, duplicates removed and json code inserted to make it ready for use.

	\subsubsection{Processeing impact}
	The API used to generate this data seems to be very heavy on the server, only to generate a file of a few megabytes required up to 20 seconds. 
	And with the largest file passing 40 megabytes and minutes to generate this functionality does not at this point seem like something you want the user to do regularly, or even at all. 
	For the time being we will include the parsed files with the aplication and update the data by rolling out a new version of the application.

	Even if this only required to download the 80megabytes and consuming a lot of resources localy on the phone for some minutes. 
	The percieved impact on the Artsdatabanken server from our view seemed significant, while not entirely sure it is highly likely that it was our constant downloading of these compelte xml files for a little bit of time crashed the ntnu server hosting the API, see figure ~\ref{fig:artsdatabanken_api}.
