\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\subsubsection{User interface}
	This application is going to be used in the mobile phone, and the UI needs to be adapted the size of the screen. It is important to keep in mind that the screen size can vary from device to device, the UI must therefore be "universal". The buttons/fields
must be simple to use in different screen sizes.
\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}
	To make this application to success the performance is very important. We have in fact that the things that this application will do, can also be done without the use of this application; by taking notes in a notebook and entering them to the computer. In order to make this application  preferable for the users, it needs to make the ``take note and enter to computer`` process simpler.  So this mobile application  needs to be easy to use, and give the user the feeling that the application is very simple. This also means that the software needs to be fast, and have good performance without any loading times.

The goal is to make the time used to register an observation less as possible compared to the manual way. The user opinion of the program has to be that, he uses less time to make observations with it. 

\subsubsection{ Safety- and Security Requirements}
	All the data entered in this application  is available for everyone in the internet, and it is therefore not necessary to protect the data entered. No specific safety or security requirements are known.
