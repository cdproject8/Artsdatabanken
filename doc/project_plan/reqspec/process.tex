\subsection{ The process}
	In our first meeting with the customer we got information about what they do and what they want from us. Both functional and non-functional requirements were discussed in general. So our group had an overview of what we were going to do. We had some issues to take up with them about a non-functional requirement; this is described in detail in section 2.6. After this meeting the group members made preliminary study to get a better overview of the task.

Our task became much clearer in the second customer meeting. This time the meeting was in their premises, where we made a field-study and saw how the application was going to be used. Here we got much more details in the functional requirements. After the field study we had a meeting with the customer, and discussed about the requirements (functional and non-functional). We talked about which functions that were most important, and made a priority of them. Some functions were more important to have than others. The non-important functions will be implemented in case the important ones are ready and there is time to make them.
