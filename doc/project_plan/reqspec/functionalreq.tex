\subsection{Functional Requirements}
The following functional requirements are described in detail in the use case section. They have different priority and complexity. The functions with high priority will be implemented first. The priorities were extrapolated from the presentations by the customer, and the complexity is based on our own estimates.

\begin{tabular}[t]{|l|p{0.5\textwidth}|l|l|p{0.15\textwidth}|}\hline
\bf ID&\bf Requirement& \bf Priority& \bf Complexity&\bf Time estimate\\\hline
F1&User must be able to create a new observation &High&Medium&0\\\hline
F2&User must be able to add more information to a species added to the observation (see use case for details) &High&Low&0\\\hline
F3&User must be able to add more species to an observation &High&Low&0\\\hline
F4&User must be able to export stored observations so they can be uploaded to Artsdatabanken later &High&High&0\\\hline
F5&User must be able to take a picture with the device's camera &Medium&Medium&0\\\hline
F6&User must be able to view observations tha are stored on the device &Low&Medium&0\\\hline
F7&User must be able to edit observations that are stored on the device &Low&Low&0\\\hline
F8&User must be able to update the local database of species and locations &Low&Medium&0\\\hline
