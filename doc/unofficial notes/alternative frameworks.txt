Titanium
Titanium is a cross-platform mobile applications development framework that uses web 
development technologies to develop applications for the Android and iOS mobile platform. 
Titanium is an open source framework that uses JavaScript and JSON as application language; 
it can also use Python, Ruby and PHP scripts. [2]


The group chose PhoneGap over Titanium and Corona because it supports 5 mobile platforms 
which was the main requirements of the customer, it uses a well known web technology standards
 that will later be compiled to native mobile applications and it is open source which is free. 
While Titanium is a cross platform framework, it only supports Android and iOS. Corona supports 
only Android and iOS, it is not free and its focus is multimedia rich content.
