Field Study notes for Andreas Berg Skomedal 05/09-2011 - CDProj08
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group species in several layers;
	birds vs fish
		seagull vs crow
			Herring Gull vs Black Legged Kittiwake
			
-Effiency of the application is important, it is to replace writing down into an observation diary and then enter in
 that information on the computer back home.
 
Information Section:
---------------------------

Emphasis on pictureinformation, tricky in an offline setting. (the bumblebee example in addition)

Report Section:
---------------------------
Fairly certain:
--
Location: GPS, note location of the observed species and not your own location if it differs notably
	Each person has predefined locations which some are linked in a hierarchy. This might not be needed on the app
Species:
	One observation is limited by [location, specie, time, age, sex]
	number: how many of the said species, estimate if not sure. 
		(method start with total number of individuals, start counting the species
		with fewest individuals and continously subtract from total)
	activity: resting/seeking food/flying/swimming etc (predefined on web)
	sex
	age
	date
	time
	(end date/time)
	comment

Less certain
--
Picture within the native application
	-originally not important, can be added online after. But the actual project
	customer really wanted this.
	-geotag/gps in metatag?
	-timetags
	-option to give a name to the image right away.
	

coobserver (max 8) (possibly just add this online)
project (possibly just add this online)



Quicknote Layout as in the diary:
---------------------------
> location <
date and time
name1 number
name2 number
name3 number
name4 number

activity, comment, etc... as specified in previous section
	perhaps as a secondary screen (or small "popup", think image in gallery) when clicking a species?




Own thoughts: (Some of which were brought up in the meeting by others as well)
---------------------------
suggest species based on selected location and/or the species allready selected.
autocomplete names

sync:
-used locations (in the past or "synced")?
-species
	-all names
	-more info on a select few or group of species?
-coobservers?
-projects?
