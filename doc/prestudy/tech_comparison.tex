\subsection{Tech comparison}

\subsubsection{Android}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can be developed using any major operating system (linux, windows, ...)
	\item Does not require any specialized hardware
	\item Android devices can be emulated (AVD). This allows for testing
		on different screen sizes, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{iOs}

\begin{itemize}
	\item iOs development requires
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Macintosh running Mac OSX
			\item iFamily device for testing
		\end{itemize}
	\item iOS based applications can be developed on iPad or IPod Touch, 
		but these devices lack accelerometer, compass, build-in GPS and 
		camera accessibility facilities
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Phonegap}
